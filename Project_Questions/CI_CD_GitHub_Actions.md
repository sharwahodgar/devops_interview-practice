# üë®‚Äçüíª Git and Version Control Interview Prep

Here are core concepts and answers regarding Git, version control, and DevOps workflows.

---

## 1. What is Git?

**Git** is a **Version Control System (VCS)**. Think of it like a powerful, digital time machine for your code.

* It tracks **every change** made to your files.
* It allows you to look back at any previous version, undo mistakes, and coordinate work among multiple people.
* Because it's **distributed**, every user has a complete copy of the project's history on their computer.

## 2. What is the difference between merge and rebase?

Both combine changes from one branch into another, but they do it differently:

| Feature | `git merge` | `git rebase` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | **Keeps** the full, chronological history. | **Rewrites** history to create a straight line. |
| **Commit** | Creates a **new "merge commit."** | Moves your commits to the end of the target branch. **No extra merge commit.** |
| **Commit Graph** | **Messy/Non-linear** (Shows when branches joined). | **Clean/Linear** (Makes history look simple). |
| **Best Used For** | Merging into long-lived branches like `main` or `dev`. | Cleaning up your local feature branch before merging it into `dev`. |

## 3. What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a **feature of hosting services** (like GitHub) used to tell others: "I've finished my work. Please review my changes, and if they look good, **pull** my code into the main branch."

It acts as the official process for **code review and quality gatekeeping**.

## 4. How do you resolve merge conflicts?

A **merge conflict** happens when two different branches change the exact same lines of code. Git pauses and asks you to manually decide which code is correct.

1.  **Open the file** that Git marks as having a conflict.
2.  Look for conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.
3.  **Manually edit the file** to include the correct code from both sides (or just one).
4.  **Remove** the conflict markers.
5.  **Stage** the edited file: `git add <file-name>`.
6.  **Commit** the merge to finish the process.

## 5. What are Git tags?

**Git tags** are like permanent, unmoving labels or stickers you put on a specific commit in your history.

* They are typically used to mark **major release points** of a project, such as **v1.0.0**.
* Unlike branches, tags **never move**. They permanently mark a known, good version of the code.

## 6. What is Git workflow?

A **Git workflow** is a defined set of rules, strategies, and procedures that a team follows to use Git effectively. It dictates:

* **When** and **how** to create branches.
* **How** to name branches (e.g., `feature/task-name`).
* **How** to integrate changes (e.g., always use a Pull Request).

## 7. Explain `git stash`

The `git stash` command is used to **temporarily save your uncommitted changes** and clean your working directory.

It's used when you need to switch branches quickly to fix a bug, but you haven't finished your current work yet and don't want to commit incomplete code. You `stash` the changes, fix the bug, and then `stash pop` the changes back later.

## 8. What is the use of `.gitignore`?

The **`.gitignore`** file is a plain text file where you list the file names and patterns that **Git should completely ignore** and **not track**.

It is used to keep the repository clean and small by ignoring files that:
1.  Are **temporary** or created automatically (like log files: `*.log`).
2.  Contain **private or sensitive data** (like configuration files).
3.  Are **very large binaries** or system files.
